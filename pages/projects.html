<h3>Collaborative-team projects</h3>
<h5>MilanoR blog and Quantide</h5>
<p>I have started a collaboration with Quantide who is sponsoring <a href="http://www.milanor.net/blog/">MilanoR</a> quote "a users group dedicated to bringing together area practitioners". So far these are the projects I have been working / have worked on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing articles about R for MilanoR. For a list of articles I wrote for MilanoR please check <a href="http://www.milanor.net/blog/author/michy.alice/">this page</a>.</li>
<li>Developed <a href="https://github.com/mick001/chartconstants">Chartconstants</a>, an R package for calculating Shewhart quality control chart constants.</li>
<li>Developing <a href="http://mick001.github.io/qanalyst/">Qanalyst</a>, an R package for calculating Shewhart quality control charts and plotting them. This project is still under development</li>
<li>Developed <a href="https://mick001.github.io/qchlorophyll/">Qcholorphyll</a>, an R package for geographical chlorophyll analysis. The aim of Qchlorophyll is to be able to analyze satellite data, calculate summary statistics on the variables of interest, then apply machine learning techniques (both unsupervised such as kmeans and supervised such as random forest) in order to predict bloom start in the selected marine bioregion (supervised task) and group similar bioregions together (unsupervised task). Qchlorophyll provides a set of functions for changing the resolution of geographical spatial data and images, as well as a set of functions for loading data from netcdf files with different data formatting and resolution. <a href="http://www.milanor.net/blog/r-satellite-data-to-identify-marine-bioregions/">Here</a> you can find a short article on marine bioregions by the researcher who commissioned me the Qchlorophyll package.</li>
<li>Translated beginner R course "Introduction to R" on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/introduzione-a-r#gs.jpbSd9U">Datacamp</a> from english to italian.  </li>
</ol>
<p>For a list of the technical articles I wrote for MilanoR, please check <a href="http://www.milanor.net/blog/author/michy-alice/">this page</a>.  </p>
<h5>Datascience+</h5>
<p>I contributed to <a href="http://datascienceplus.com/">DSP</a>, a multi-author project website aimed at providing different levels tutorials for <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. DSP is a highly valuable resource for everyone who would like to learn R and needs to start from scratch or even R-users who would like to improve their knowledge of R. You can check my posts both at <a href="http://datascienceplus.com/author/mic/">DSP</a> or <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/author/michy-alice/">R-bloggers</a>. I have been pleaseantly surprised when I found out that three out of the four posts I wrote for DSP were among the <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/100-must-read-r-bloggers-posts-for-2015/">"top 100 most read R posts in 2015"</a> in the Rbloggers site, which I regard as one of the best reference points of the R community. Namely these posts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>"How to perform a Logistic Regression in R", 6th place.</li>
<li>"Fitting a neural network in R; neuralnet package", 13th place.</li>
<li>"Imputing missing data with R; MICE package", 42th place.  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Personal projects</h3>
<h5>The Beginner Programmer.</h5>
<p>My personal blog <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com">The Beginner Programmer</a> is a collection of experiments and applications of my knowledge of machine learning, programming and engineering. Whenever I read about something and find it interesting I may write some code about it and then turn it into a short article. The Beginner Programmer is listed on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">Rbloggers</a> and is a regular contributor of posts to the R community. You can find the relevant posts of The Beginner Programmer listed on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">Rbloggers</a> at <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/author/mic/">this page</a>, <a href="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</a> and <a href="http://www.statsblogs.com/">StatsBlogs</a>.</p>

<h5>IV &amp; CV automated curve tracer application</h5>
<p>I'm currently testing a IV &amp; CV automated curve tracer application in LabVIEW.</p>
<p>The application is currently under final testing and I'm writing the user's manual. The application has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trace IV or CV characteristics of a 2, 3, 4, 5 terminal electrical/electronic component.</li>
<li>Independent and dependent bias voltage settings (the second bias can be set as a function of the first one).</li>
<li>The main voltage source and the bias source(s) can be chosen among 5 different instruments (Yokogawa 7651, Keithley 6487, Keithley 6430, TTI QL-355TP and ISEG NHQ223M.</li>
<li>Yokogawa 7651 and Keithley 6430 can also be used as current sources.</li>
<li>Up to 4 simultaneous current and up to 2 voltage measurements using Keithley 6485, Keithley 6487, Keithley 6430 and Agilent 34970A.</li>
<li>CV measurements are performed using Agilent 4263B. The parameters measured by default are Cp and delta, however other parameters can be measured too.</li>
<li>Main functions/settings of the instruments can be set by remote (current/voltage compliance, digital filters, math, integration time, etc...)</li>
<li>External average function with a number of points specified by the user.</li>
<li>Measurement report in html format with graphs of the measurements.</li>
<li>Save/Load measurement configuration.</li>
<li>Measurement data can be loaded back into the application and reviewed at a later stage.</li>
</ul>
<p>As of now, I've tested the application diodes, N-FETs, ceramic capacitors and NPN transistors. Some testing was also done on high value resistors (giga and tera ohms resistors) to test the current measuring capabilities of the Keithley 6430 Sub-Femtoamp Remote SourceMeter.</p>
<p>I plan on making a webpage with some details of the development and test results soon.</p>

<h3>Electrical Engineering projects</h3>
<h5><a href="https://github.com/michy-alice/michy-alice.github.io/blob/master/impianto_BT_MT.zip">Low and medium voltage electrical distribution lines design</a></h5>
<p>This project was part of an assignment we were given during the third year. The project aims at designing: 5 low voltage transmission lines (230-400V), a medium voltage line (20kV), a power factor correction system, safety circuit breakers and switches, and distribution transfomer. </p>
<p>The project has been completed according to the 2016 italian regulatory framework for electrical power distribution.
You can find the complete report, calculations and datasheets <a href="https://github.com/michy-alice/michy-alice.github.io/blob/master/impianto_BT_MT.zip">here</a>.</p>
<h5><a href="https://github.com/michy-alice/michy-alice.github.io/blob/master/pump.pdf">Pumping water out of deep well into a reservoir</a></h5>
<p>This is an interesting project aimed at combining my theoretical knowledge of fluid dynamics and engineering: the aim of the project is to model a pump able to transport water from a deep well into a reservoir. I am currently working on all the necessary calculations and modelling issues. The report of the project is available <a href="https://github.com/michy-alice/michy-alice.github.io/blob/master/pump.pdf">here</a>. Furthermore, in <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/07/fluid-dynamics-pressure-drop-modelling.html">this post</a> I shared a part of the fluid dynamics modelling.</p>
<h5>Control circuit for a DC permanent magnet motor</h5>
<p>As a classical control problem, the aim of this project is to design a stable circuit that enables the user to set the speed of rotation of the DC motor. By setting a fixed voltage as input proportional to the desired angular speed, the control system made of a PI controller speeds the rotor up to the desired speed.   </p>
<h5>"Balancing a ball on a beam"</h5>
<p>Another classical control problem solved using a controller of the PID family. This project helped me in getting some "hands on" practical engineering and control theory from design to physical implementation of the model. I am currently writing a report of the project and I plan to release it as soon as I finish it.</p>

<h3>Other "side projects"</h3>
<h5><a href="https://mick001.github.io/ArduinoCommClass/">ArduinoCommClass</a></h5>
<p>This is a programm written in Python used for exchanging data with your Arduino Uno board. It could probably used with other Arduino boards as long as they support serial port communication with your laptop but since I own just the Uno, I tested that particular board only. If you click on the project, you can find some example of application such as the <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2015/08/using-arduino-to-measure-friction.html">estimation of the friction coefficient</a> of a particular surface.</p>
<h5><a href="https://mick001.github.io/control_charts_shiny/">Control charts Shiny App</a></h5>
<p>A Shiny app to plot control charts from a given .csv file. This was one of my first projects with Shiny and R.
Given a .csv file with observations of as many variables as you like, you can plot the <em>x-bar</em> and <em>s</em> charts of the grouped observations. The chart will display one variable at a time.</p>
<h5><a href="https://mick001.github.io/PIDcontroller/">PID controller</a></h5>
<p>This project is a Python3 implementation of a PID controller algorithm with anti-wind up. There are some examples of application. The controller can optionally return the transfer function for further in-depth analysis in the frequency domain.</p>
<h5><a href="https://mick001.github.io/OptionPricingClass/">Option pricing class</a></h5>
<p>Since I occasionally like to apply my coding skills to quantitative finance, I decided to write a simple program for calculating the price of plain vanilla call and put option using Monte Carlo simulation and Black &amp; Scholes formula. This program was written also in Java and C++ as a pure coding exercise. Its results are detailed in related post and are close to those provided by Google Finance. You can find a more detailed explanation in <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2015/08/european-option-pricing-with-python.html">this post</a>.</p></div>
