<h3>Collaborative-team projects</h3>
<h5>MilanoR blog and Quantide</h5>
<p>I have started a collaboration with Quantide who is sponsoring <a href="http://www.milanor.net/blog/">MilanoR</a> quote "a users group dedicated to bringing together area practitioners". So far these are the projects I have been working / have worked on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing articles about R for MilanoR. For a list of articles I wrote for MilanoR please check <a href="">this page</a>.</li>
<li>Developed <a href="https://github.com/mick001/chartconstants">Chartconstants</a>, an R package for calculating Shewhart quality control chart constants.</li>
<li>Developing <a href="https://github.com/mick001/qanalyst">Qanalyst</a>, an R package for calculating Shewhart quality control charts and plotting them. This project is still under development</li>
<li>Developed <a href="https://github.com/pegoraro/qchlorophyll">Qcholorphyll</a>, an R package for geographical chlorophyll analysis. The aim of Qchlorophyll is to be able to analyze satellite data, calculate summary statistics on the variables of interest, then apply machine learning techniques (both unsupervised such as kmeans and supervised such as random forest) in order to predict bloom start in the selected bioregion.</li>
<li>Translated beginner R course "Introduction to R" on <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/introduzione-a-r#gs.jpbSd9U">Datacamp</a> from english to italian.  </li>
</ol>
<p>For a list of articles I wrote for MilanoR, please check <a href="http://www.milanor.net/blog/author/michy-alice/">this page</a>.  </p>
<h5>Datascience+</h5>
<p>I contributed to <a href="http://datascienceplus.com/">DSP</a>, a multi-author project website aimed at providing different levels tutorials for <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>. DSP is a highly valuable resource for everyone who would like to learn R and needs to start from scratch or even R-users who would like to improve their knowledge of R. You can check my posts both at <a href="http://datascienceplus.com/author/mic/">DSP</a> or <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/author/michy-alice/">R-bloggers</a>. I have been pleaseantly surprised when I found out that three out of the four posts I wrote for DSP were among the <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/100-must-read-r-bloggers-posts-for-2015/">"top 100 most read R posts in 2015"</a> in the Rbloggers site, which I regard as one of the best reference points of the R community. Namely these posts are:</p>
<ol>
<li>"How to perform a Logistic Regression in R", 6th place.</li>
<li>"Fitting a neural network in R; neuralnet package", 13th place.</li>
<li>"Imputing missing data with R; MICE package", 42th place.  </li>
</ol>

<h5>Aladino Technology LTD</h5>
<p>I worked a few years for an international company based in Shenzhen, operating in the renewable energies and LED light business. During this experience I was assigned different tasks and developed further my growing passion for numbers and electrical engineering. Among the tasks that led me to where I find myself today, you can find:</p>
<ol>
<li>Selecting new LED lamps in dedicated international fairs.</li>
<li>Making amortization plans for LED lights implementation.</li>
<li>Making savings vs cost calculations to support customer decisions on whether to install LED lights, PV solar systems and solar water pumps.</li>
<li>Engineer personalised customer-centric LED lighting solutions.</li>
<li>Estimating costs due to defective products and forecasting average cost per year.</li>
<li>Support management in analysing yearly reports.</li>
<li>Attending, both as exhibitor and visitor, international lighting and energy fairs.  </li>
</ol>

<h3>Personal projects</h3>
<h5>The Beginner Programmer.</h5>
<p>My personal blog <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com">The Beginner Programmer</a> is a collection of experiments and applications of my knowledge of machine learning, programming and engineering. Whenever I read about something and find it interesting I may write some code about it and then turn it into a short article. The Beginner Programmer is listed on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">Rbloggers</a> and is a regular contributor of posts to the R community. You can find the relevant posts of The Beginner Programmer listed on <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/">Rbloggers</a> at <a href="http://www.r-bloggers.com/author/mic/">this page</a>, <a href="http://planetpython.org/">Planet Python</a> and <a href="http://www.statsblogs.com/">StatsBlogs</a>.</p>

<h3>Academic work</h3>
<h5>Thesis: "An introduction to copula theory"</h5>
<p>As of now, only italian version is available). Available for free at <a href="http://www.grin.com/it/e-book/283567/una-introduzione-alla-teoria-delle-copule">Grin</a>.
I wrote some tutorials on how to use copulas, the most interesting, in my opinion is this two part piece: <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/03/how-to-fit-copula-model-in-r-heavily.html">How to fit a copula model  in R part 1</a> and <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/03/how-to-fit-copula-model-in-r-heavily_29.html">How to fit a copula model  in R part 2</a>.</p>
<h5>Electronics laboratory experiences (italian only)</h5>
<p>This is a collection of empirical measurements on some common electronics circuits made in the laboratory and critical comparisons with the simulated measurements using LTSpice IV. It can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/michy-alice/michy-alice.github.io/raw/master/labs_to.pdf">here</a>.
Some of the the topics include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Voltage dividers.</li>
<li>RC and CR networks.</li>
<li>Coupled RC and CR networks.</li>
<li>Operational amplifiers.</li>
<li>Integrators and derivative circuits.</li>
<li>Transistors (BJT) characteristic estimation.</li>
<li>Transistors (BJT) as amplifiers.</li>
<li>Transistors (BJT) as switches.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Electrical Engineering side projects</h3>
<h5>"Balancing a ball on a beam"</h5>
<p>A classical control problem solved using a controller of the PID family. This project helped me in getting some "hands on" practical engineering and control theory from design to physical implementation of the model. I am currently writing a report of the project and I plan to release it as soon as I finish it.   </p>
<h5>Pumping water out of deep well into a reservoir</h5>
<p>This is an interesting project aimed at combining my theoretical knowledge of fluid dynamics and engineering: the aim of the project is to model a pump able to transport water from a deep well into a reservoir. I am currently working on all the necessary calculations and modelling issues. The report of the project is available <a href="https://github.com/michy-alice/michy-alice.github.io/blob/master/pump.pdf">here</a>. Furthermore, in <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2016/07/fluid-dynamics-pressure-drop-modelling.html">this post</a> I shared a part of the fluid dynamics modelling.</p>

<h3>Other side projects</h3>
<h5><a href="https://mick001.github.io/ArduinoCommClass/">ArduinoCommClass</a></h5>
<p>This is a programm written in Python used for exchanging data with your Arduino Uno board. It could probably used with other Arduino boards as long as they support serial port communication with your laptop but since I own just the Uno, I tested that particular board only. If you click on the project, you can find some example of application such as the <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2015/08/using-arduino-to-measure-friction.html">estimation of the friction coefficient</a> of a particular surface.</p>
<h5><a href="https://mick001.github.io/PIDcontroller/">PID controller</a></h5>
<p>This project is a Python3 implementation of a PID controller algorithm with anti-wind up. There are some examples of application. The controller can optionally return the transfer function for further in-depth analysis in the frequency domain.</p>
<h5><a href="https://mick001.github.io/OptionPricingClass/">Option pricing class</a></h5>
<p>Since I occasionally like to apply my coding skills to quantitative finance, I decided to write a simple program for calculating the price of plain vanilla call and put option using Monte Carlo simulation and Black &amp; Scholes formula. This program was written also in Java and C++ as a pure coding exercise. Its results are detailed in related post and are close to those provided by Google Finance. You can find a more detailed explanation in <a href="http://firsttimeprogrammer.blogspot.com/2015/08/european-option-pricing-with-python.html">this post</a>.</p></div>
